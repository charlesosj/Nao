Behaviors.py
when run robot will stand up and  enable all joints.. on exit will sit down and disable joints
python behaviors.py 10.18.12.56 (Robot IP)

publishing to /nao_behavior/add of type String
Behaviors can be queued
you can replace the string with
wakeup
rest
wait <seconds>
say
say animated
help  provides list of system behaviors
search
move (moves forward and backwards)
rotate ( turn the body)
anyother string is treated as a system behavior
Example rostopic pub -1 /nao_behavior/add std_msgs/String -- 'System/animations/Stand/Emotions/Neutral/Hello_1'

publishing to /nao_behavior/head of type Float32MultiArray
Moves the nao`s head 
[0] yaw
[1] pitch
[2] speed



if you say after a behavior a move, both will be executed at the same time
if you want the robot to move and then say, put a wait in between the calls
This doesnt apply to say animated, that will always run on its own

2.rosrun rviz rviz -d ~/catkin_ws/src/nao_robot/nao_description/config/urdf.rviz


Notes
can use choreograph to wake up and make the Nao sit down but you can also call the following after nao.launch is called to enable and disable stiffness (behaviors.py does this for you too'

rosservice call /body_stiffness/disable "{}"
rosservice call /body_stiffness/enable "{}"
